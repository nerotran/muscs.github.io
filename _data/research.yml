- title: Sustainance against Jamming using Honeynet in Cognitive Radio Network
  img: "images/cahannel_allocation.jpg"
  desc: |
    Open and dynamic spectrum access model brings forth a serious challenge of sustenance among the CRN
    and makes them more susceptible to jamming-based denial of service (DoS) attacks. Inspired by
    honeypot in the network security, we propose a honeynet based defense mechanism called CR-honeynet.
    CR-honeynet aims to avoid attacks on legitimate communications by dedicating a Secondary User (SU) as a honeynode,
    to deter the attacker from attacking legitimate SUs and attack the honeynode instead.

    Directional  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  /  Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers have the potential
    to play a significant role in  future generation  wireless networks.  They are  advantageous in
    terms of  improved spectrum  utilization,  higher data transfer rate,  and lower  probability of
    interception  from unwanted sources. Despite these advantages, communications using directional
    transceivers require  establishment and  maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS). Thus, the establishment
    of the communication link or neighbor discovery plays a significant role in mobile ad hoc networks
    with RF/FSO directional transceivers. In this project, we design protocols for discovering LOS
    of a neighbor for both in-band and out-of-band cases.

    In multihop ad hoc networks, a jammer can drastically disrupt the flow of
    information by intentionally interfering with links between a subset of nodes.
    The impact of such attacks can escalate when the jammer is moving. As a countermeasure for
    such attacks, adaptive beam-forming techniques can be employed for spatial filtering of the
    jamming signal. This paper investigates the performance of adaptive beam nulling
     as a mitigation technique against jamming attacks in multihop ad hoc networks.
     Considering a moving jammer, a distributed beam nulling framework is proposed.

    UAV networks are envisioned to play a crucial role in the future generations
    of wireless networks. Due to the high cost of failures in system-based tests,
    initial analysis and refinement of designs and algorithms for UAV applications
    are performed through rigorous simulations. To facilitate such simulations for
    UAV systems, we presents different mobility models for emulation of a UAV's
     movement. We further extend these models by considering the effect of large
     obstacles on movement patterns following the three models. The mobility models
      are prepared as open-source add-ons for ns-3 network simulator.

    In WiMAX deployment, the challenges to service providers lie with the Quality
    of Service (QoS) under varying fading environment while at the same time maximizing
    for resource utilization. In this research, a rigorous and comprehensive
    performance study of mobile WiMAX     has  been  made  with  respect  to
    adaptive  modulation  and  coding  techniques  considering  the  variation  in
    the speed of the mobile, path-loss, scheduling services and application
    type for comparing with the fixed     type of modulations.
