### Organization and Policies
  - **WebCampus**   Except this web page, all course materials will be posted at the WebCampus.
  - **Quizzes and In-class Activities**   There will be approximately 4-6 in-class quizzes. These quizzes will be time-constrained, i.e., 15-20mins. There will be problems to analyze and solve on the current topic. You must come to each class having read the assigned materials and viewed the assigned online references.
  - **Homework**   There will be approximately 4 homework assignments.
  - **Exams**   There will be two midterm exams and one final exam (see Schedule for tentative dates).
  - **Paper Submissions**   As a result of classroom activities, quizzes, homeworks or other assignments, you may be turning in your assignments on paper. Unless otherwise specified, the submission papers should be 8Â½ x 11 inch (or close to this measurement). If submitting multiple pages, you must staple them and write your name on every page. Your paper submissions may not be accepted if your paper does not meet these specifications.
  - **Late Submissions**   Late submissions will be penalized by 20% per day.
  - **Sickness or Athletic Activities**   To assure that you will be granted for late submissions or waiving of some of the assignments, you must provide the paperwork for your health problems or athletic activities you have to attend.
  - **Academic Integrity**   Any form of cheating such as plagiarism or ghostwriting will incur a severe penalty, usually failure in the course. Please refer to the UNR policy on Academic Standards.
  - **Disability Statement**   If you have a disability for which you will need to request accommodations, please contact the instructor or someone at the Disability Resource Center (Thompson Student Services - 107) as soon as possible.
  - **Important Policy**   Surreptitious or covert videotaping of class or unauthorized audio recording of class is prohibited by law and by Board of Regents policy. This class may be videotaped or audio recorded only with the written permission of the instructor. In order to accommodate students with disabilities, some students may have been given permission to record class lectures and discussions. Therefore, students should understand that their comments during class may be recorded.
