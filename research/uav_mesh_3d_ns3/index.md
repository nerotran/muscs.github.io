title: 3D Obstacle Compliant Mobility Models for UAV networks in ns-3

UAV networks are envisioned to play a crucial role in the future generations of wireless networks. 
Due to the high cost of failures in system-based tests, initial analysis and refinement of designs and 
algorithms for UAV applications are performed through rigorous simulations. 
To facilitate such simulations for UAV systems, we presents different mobility models for 
emulation of a UAV's movement. We further extend these models by considering the effect of 
large obstacles on movement patterns following the three models. The mobility models are prepared 
as open-source add-ons for ns-3 network simulator.

There are currently three mobility models with the adaptations implemented:

- Random Walk
- Random Direction
- Gauss-Markov
