    Directional  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  /  Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers have the potential 
    to play a significant role in  future generation  wireless networks.  They are  advantageous in  
    terms of  improved spectrum  utilization,  higher data transfer rate,  and lower  probability of 
    interception  from unwanted sources. Despite these advantages, communications using directional 
    transceivers require  establishment and  maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS). Thus, the establishment 
    of the communication link or neighbor discovery plays a significant role in mobile ad hoc networks 
    with RF/FSO directional transceivers. In this project, we design protocols for discovering LOS
    of a neighbor for both in-band and out-of-band cases.
