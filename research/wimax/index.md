### Problem Statement and Motivation
WiMAXâ€”the  Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access is a promising technology for offering
high-speed data, video and multimedia services over mobile platform evolving toward all IP networks. The
increasing demand of WiMAX for VoIP and high-speed multimedia is due to the simplicity of installation
and cost reduction compared with the traditional wired DSL cable. The challenges to service providers lie
with the Quality of Service (QoS) under varying fading environment while at the same time maximizing
for resource utilization. In this research, a rigorous and comprehensive performance study of mobile WiMAX
has  been  made  with  respect  to  adaptive  modulation  and  coding  techniques  considering  the  variation  in
the speed of the mobile, path-loss, scheduling services and application type for comparing with the fixed
type of modulations. The OPNET 14.5.A modeler for WiMAX platform has been used as simulator for
adaptation  at  the  physical  layer  of  the  transmission  in  WiMAX  OFDMA  structure.  Observation  reveals
that  dynamic  adaptation  of  modulation  and  coding  schemes  based  on  channel  condition  enables  better
QoS while consuming low overall bandwidth of the system.
